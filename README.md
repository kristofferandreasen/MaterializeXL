# MaterializeXL
A small CSS file that creates an XL column option in materialize for larger screens

I work on a wide screen and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one. In order to leverage the full width of these screens, the standard options for columns in the Materializecss grid are not enough.

I have created an extra large column, which means you can simply add an extra css file instead of creating a bunch of extra css.

Enjoy!
